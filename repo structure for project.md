 For this project, you should maintain two separate repositories: one for
 the backend service and one for the iOS application.
 This is the standard and most effective professional workflow. Keeping them separate is crucial
 for organization, independent development, and future scalability.
 Your Project Repository Strategy
 1. Backend Repository (e.g., 
apple-ocr-backend
 )
 Purpose: This repository will house the Python code for your OCR processing service.
 Action Plan:
 Create a new, empty repository on your GitHub account.
 Locally, you will take the core logic from the 
jornl/ipad-ocr
 project.
 You will then refactor and customize that logic into a new FastAPI application, as we
 planned.
 This new, clean backend code will be committed and pushed to this repository.
 2. iOS App Repository (e.g., 
apple-ocr-ios-app
 )
 Purpose: This will contain the Swift and SwiftUI code for the native iOS application that
 users will interact with.
 Action Plan:
 Create a second new, empty repository on your GitHub.
 Use the 
StewartLynch/Live-Text-in-iOS-16
 repository as your guide and reference.
 You will build a new Xcode project for your app, implementing the scanning features
 based on the reference project.
 This new iOS project will be committed and pushed to this repository.
Why This Separation is Critical
 Aspect
 Organization
 Development
 Benefit of Separate Repositories
 The codebases are completely independent. Python backend logic is not mixed with Swift
 frontend logic, making the project clean and easy to navigate.
 You can work on the backend API without touching the iOS app, and vice versa. This allows
 for parallel work and focused development.
 Deployment
 Technology
 Stack
 You can deploy updates to the backend (e.g., improve the OCR accuracy) without needing to
 rebuild and resubmit the iOS app to the App Store.
 Each repository can have its own specific dependencies, build tools, and environment
 configurations (
 requirements.txt
 for Python, Xcode build settings for iOS.
 Scalability
 How They Will Interact
 In the future, if you want to add an Android app or a web interface, you would simply create a
 third repository for it, which would communicate with the same, single backend.
 The two separate applications will communicate over the network via the API you build.

 In summary, your plan to fork two repositories and maintain them separately is the correct and
 professional approach that will set you up for success in both the one-week MVP and the full
scale project

jornl/ipad-ocr
 repository is an excellent starting point. It
 provides a solid foundation for about 40% of the MVP's backend logic, which aligns perfectly
 with our goal of rapid prototyping. By making targeted customizations, we can adapt it to our
 specific needs within the first two days of the plan.
 How the Repository Matches Our Development Plan
 The repository provides several key features that we can use immediately, saving significant
 development time:
 Live Video Processing: The core logic for capturing frames from a live webcam feed using
 OpenCV is already built. This is a perfect foundation for our prototype's input method.
 OCR Integration: It has a working pipeline for taking an image frame, passing it to an OCR
 engine, and extracting text. We will swap the engine, but the pipeline structure is sound.
 File-Based Data Handling: The system is designed to read from and write to CSV files. This
 can be easily adapted to our plan of exporting data to an Excel file using 
openpyxl
 .
 Multi-threading: The script uses threads to process frames concurrently, which aligns with
 our requirement for a performant system that doesn't freeze during processing.
 Required Customizations to Build Our MVP
 Here is a detailed, actionable list of the changes needed to transform this repository into our
 MVP.
 1. Upgrade the OCR Engine Highest Priority)
 What to do: Replace the 
pytesseract
 OCR engine with 
EasyOCR
 .
 Why: EasyOCR offers significantly higher accuracy for alphanumeric serial numbers out-of
the-box and is a core requirement for our system's reliability.
Action:
 Remove 
pytesseract
 from 
requirements.txt
 .
 Add 
easyocr
 to 
requirements.txt
 .
 In 
main.py
 , replace the Tesseract processing call with an EasyOCR reader instance.
 # Before (in main.py)
 # text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame)
 # After (our new implementation)
 import easyocr
 reader = easyocr.Reader(['en']) # Initialize once
 results = reader.readtext(frame)
 # Process results list
 2. Refactor into a FastAPI Backend
 What to do: Convert the standalone script into an API service.
 Why: Our iOS app needs a network endpoint to send images to. A standalone script cannot
 accept requests from other devices.
 Action:
 Create a new file, 
api.py
 .
 Wrap the core OCR processing logic within a FastAPI POST endpoint (e.g., 
serial
 ).
 /process
The endpoint will accept an uploaded image, perform OCR, and return a JSON
 response.
 # New api.py
 from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
 # ... import your OCR logic ...
 app = FastAPI()
 @app.post("/process-serial/")
 async def process_image(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
 image_data = await file.read()
 # Call your OCR processing function here
 serial_number = perform_ocr(image_data)
 return {"serial_number": serial_number}
 3. Overhaul the Validation Logic
 What to do: Remove the existing logic that matches serials against leasing agreement CSVs
 and replace it with Apple-specific format validation.
 Why: The current validation is tied to the original author's business case. Our system needs
 a more generic and accurate validation method for Apple products.
 Action:
Delete the code that reads from the 
# New validation function
 import re
 /agreements
 folder.
 Implement a function that uses regular expressions (regex) to check if the OCR output
 matches a typical 12-character Apple serial number format.
 def is_valid_apple_serial(text):
 # A simple regex for a 12-character alphanumeric serial
 # This can be refined further
 pattern = re.compile(r'^[A-Z0-9]{12}$')
 return pattern.match(text) is not None
 4. Automate the Workflow and Remove User Prompts
 What to do: Eliminate all 
input()
 prompts that ask the user to confirm updates or enter
 school information.
 Why: Our system needs to be a fast, automated "machine" that processes data without
 manual intervention. The user interaction will be handled by the iOS app, not the backend
 script.
 Action:
 Search for and remove all 
input()
 calls within the script.
 Modify the logic so that once a valid serial number is found, it is automatically saved
 without asking for confirmation.
 5. Implement Excel Export
 xlsx
 ) file.
 What to do: Replace the CSV writing logic with a function that appends data to an Excel
 (
 .
 Why: Excel is the required output format for business reporting as per our plan.
 Action:
 Add 
openpyxl
 to 
requirements.txt
 .
 Create a function 
save_to_excel(serial_number)
 that opens 
new row with the serial and a timestamp, and saves the file.
 serials.xlsx
 , appends a
 By focusing on these five key areas of customization, we can efficiently adapt the 
jornl/ipad
ocr
 repository into a functional backend for our MVP, perfectly aligning with our 7-day
 development schedule

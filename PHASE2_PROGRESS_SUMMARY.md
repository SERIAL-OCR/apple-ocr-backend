# Phase 2 Progress Summary

##  Completed Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.1: Architecture and UX
**Status**: COMPLETED and tested
- **Backend API**: `POST /serials` endpoint for on-device OCR submissions
- **Database**: Enhanced schema with source, notes, validation tracking
- **Security**: API key authentication and validation
- **Observability**: `/stats`, enhanced `/health`, `/config` endpoints
- **Cleanup**: Completely removed all image upload functionality
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ All 9/9 backend API tests passing

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.2: iOS/macOS Scanner Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETED and ready for device testing
- **iOS Scanner**: SwiftUI app with Vision/VisionKit integration
  - Real-time camera preview with ROI overlay
  - Auto-capture with best-of-N frame selection (4s window, 10 frames max)
  - Manual capture with flash control
  - Status indicators and settings
- **macOS Scanner**: SwiftUI app with Vision/AVFoundation
  - Camera preview with manual controls
  - Same OCR logic as iOS version
- **Backend Integration**: Full integration with Phase 2.1 API
  - Serial submission with validation
  - History viewing and export
  - Health checks and configuration

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.3: Client-side Validation and Post-processing
**Status**: COMPLETED and tested
- **AppleSerialValidator Class**: Comprehensive validation logic
  - Position-aware character corrections (12 positions, OCR-specific mappings)
  - Known Apple serial prefix detection (C02-C0F, CO2-COF, single-char prefixes)
  - Position-specific pattern validation
  - Apple serial format rules (last 4 chars contain digit, middle mix)
  - Confidence shaping with penalties/bonuses
  - Validation levels: ACCEPT, BORDERLINE, REJECT
- **Validation Features**:
  - Character disambiguation based on position context
  - Known prefix detection with confidence bonuses
  - Unknown prefix identification with rejection
  - Position-specific pattern validation
  - Apple serial format compliance checks
  - Confidence adjustment based on corrections/warnings
  - User confirmation logic for borderline cases
- **Submission Logic**:
  - REJECT level: Never submit
  - ACCEPT level: Always submit
  - BORDERLINE level: Submit only with user confirmation
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ All 7/7 validation tests passing

## Phased Development Plan for Apple Serial Number OCR System

### 1. Executive Summary
This report outlines a phased development strategy for an Apple device serial number Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, progressing from a rapid Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution.

The initial 7-day MVP aims to quickly demonstrate core OCR capabilities and secure client approval. This lean approach prioritizes rapid validation, learning, and minimal upfront investment. Upon successful MVP validation, the project transitions to a multi-week full system development phase focused on enhanced features, robust deployment, and long-term operational excellence.

### 2. Project Overview and Core Principles

#### 2.1 Project Goals and Success Criteria
- **Primary objective**: Deliver a working prototype within 7 days to demonstrate Apple serial number OCR and secure approval for full-scale development.
- **Timeline**: 6 development days + 1 demo day
- **Effort**: 40–50 hours total
- **Investment**: Development time only (no additional hardware costs for the MVP)
- **Success criterion**: 90%+ OCR accuracy and a smooth client demonstration

#### 2.2 System Working Principles: Apple Serial Number Recognition Flow
The recognition flow is a multi-stage process for accurately capturing, processing, and storing serial numbers:

1. Image Capture: iOS app uses native camera APIs to acquire an image of the device.
2. Preprocessing: Enhance images for reflective surfaces like aluminum and glass.
3. OCR Processing: EasyOCR extracts text with confidence scoring.
4. Validation: Check against Apple serial number patterns (e.g., 12-character format).
5. API Verification (Optional): Real-time integration with Apple's API to enhance accuracy.
6. Data Storage: Persist validated serial number and metadata in a local database.
7. Excel Export: Generate a business-ready spreadsheet report.

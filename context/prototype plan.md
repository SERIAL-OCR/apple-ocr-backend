## One-Week Prototype Development Plan

This plan outlines a focused 7-day sprint to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Apple serial number OCR system. The goal is to rapidly validate the core technology, demonstrate feasibility, and secure client approval for full-scale development.

### Day 1: Environment Setup & Foundation
- **Focus**: Establish the core development environment and project structure.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create a Python virtual environment and install: `easyocr`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `opencv-python`, `openpyxl`.
  - Clone and analyze key open-source repositories to identify potential integration points.
  - Set up the initial FastAPI project structure.

### Day 2: Core OCR Implementation
- **Focus**: Implement the central OCR functionality and processing pipeline.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Integrate EasyOCR with custom preprocessing logic for reflective Apple surfaces.
  - Construct the processing pipeline to extract serial numbers from images.
  - Achieve a target of 90%+ OCR accuracy on a set of test images.

### Day 3: Validation & API Endpoints
- **Focus**: Add validation logic and create robust API endpoints.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Research and implement validation patterns for the 12-character Apple serial number format.
  - Develop a FastAPI endpoint that integrates this validation with comprehensive error handling.
  - Rigorously test the API using tools like Postman or `curl`.

### Day 4: iOS Integration
- **Focus**: Connect the backend to a native iOS application.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Build a user interface for scanning on iOS, leveraging Apple's VisionKit.
  - Establish connectivity to the backend API to send recognized text for processing.
- **Risk Management**: Highest-risk day. Prepare a backup web interface in case of integration challenges.

### Day 5: Excel Export & Refinement
- **Focus**: Finalize core features and polish the system.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Implement Excel export using `openpyxl` to generate a report with timestamps, serial numbers, and confidence scores.
  - Conduct a final pass for performance optimization.

### Day 6 (Weekend): Buffer & Documentation
- **Focus**: Bug fixing, final preparation, and demo practice.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Fix any remaining bugs discovered during testing.
  - Assemble all materials needed for the client demonstration.
  - Conduct practice runs of the live demo.

### Day 7 (Demo Day): Client Demonstration
- **Focus**: Present the prototype and secure approval.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Deliver a live, 15-minute demonstration of the working iOS app and backend.
  - Gather client feedback and discuss next steps for the full project.

The ultimate goal is to get client approval to proceed.

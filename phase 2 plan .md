# based on our resrarch and rengineering plan create a detailed phase 2 plan with the resourecs ands repo to use the technilogy to use and the chnages to do on top pf mvp and start the phase 2 implementaation

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive, research-backed **Phase 2 implementation plan** for your Apple-level OCR system, leveraging open-source resources, ANE optimizations, and the engineering roadmap you‚Äôve built. This plan is designed to move from your current MVP (YOLO + EasyOCR + Tesseract) to an enterprise-grade, Apple-class OCR solution capable of 95‚Äì98% accuracy and 2‚Äì4s average latency.

- Use Blender/3D rendering or GANs to simulate Apple device surfaces and lighting (based on [Apple Synthetic Data Generation])[^1]
- Generate 100,000+ serial number training images with all Apple fonts and surface types
- Periodically retrain models with hard client cases


#### **4. Hardware Optimization**

- Apply ANE tensor format, chunking, and quantization as per [`ml-ane-transformers`] docs and research
- Benchmark inference speed on Apple Silicon M1/M2+ and adjust model micro-architecture for best performance
- Batch API inference on server/edge deployments


#### **5. Integration \& API Changes**

- Update background job system for faster job assignment and processing
- Add endpoints for retraining/fine-tuning, synthetic sample generation, and accuracy feedback loop


#### **6. Benchmarking \& Monitoring**

- Set up performance and accuracy dashboards (latency, memory, quality metrics)
- Cross-validate pipeline against VisionKit outputs on test images
